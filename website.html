<b><p>The founder of the College Seth Makhan Lal (1909-1965) was a great philanthropist and a visionary. He was a kind-hearted intellectual and a Karamyogi who believed in Bhagwat Gita’s  Philosophy of  “Nishkam Karma”. He was a living symbol of humility and simplicity. He belonged to a renowned aggarwal family of Pundri and later on shifted to Kaithal (Kapisthal of ancient times) where he lived till the end of his life. He was an enlightened soul and knew very well that service of the fellow beings is the greatest service.  
</p>
<p>When the idea of setting up a college in Kaithal was mooted before him by some eminent persons of the city, he immediately made up his mind to contribute large heartedly for this noble act. He volunteered ahead of all others and gave the idea a practical shape by establishing a charitable educational society called Rastriya Vidya Samiti in 1954. He donated his movable and immovable property for starting the college. With the support of other traders and intellectual  of the town , he was able to start the first college of the city i.e. Radha Krishan Sanatan Dharm College in the year 1954. The college was christened after the name of his revered father-in-law Sh. Radha Krishan Ji.

Although Seth Makhan Lal was also associated with various other organizations of social service like Aggarwal Panchayat Sabha, Kurukshetra Gaushala, Aggarwal Dharmshala, Hospitals and Jairamdas Aggarwal Girls School but is greatest contribution to the people of the area and that of Kaithal city is R.K.S.D. College. He will always be remembered for this great contribution for the people of Kaithal. Generation after generation is getting the benefit of Higher Studies in the institution founded by him. It is with the blessing of pious souls like Seth Makhan Lal Ji that R.K.S.D. Degree College has now become a group of institutions comprising of a Senior Secondary School, a Pharmacy College and an Education College. It is progressing by leaps and bounds and has ambitious plans for further expansion in the near future.
</p>
Seth Makhan Lal ji departed for heavenly aboard on 21 Dec. 1965 after living a purposeful life of 56 years. It is so said that the purpose of life is a life of purpose and Seth Ji proved this saying by following a noble purpose of life. Although, he is not physically present amidst us but his enlightened approach to life and his vision will always remain a source of inspiration for all of us. Every year the birthday of Seth Ji i.e. 5th  December is celebrated in the college as the founder’s day. On this day, a mega blood donation camp is organized in memory of Seth Ji. The management and the staff of the college perform Hawan Ceremony on this day as a mark of founder’s day celebration which is followed by cultural programme under the banner of Alumni Association of the College.
