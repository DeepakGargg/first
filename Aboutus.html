<p><B> In the post-independence era, Kaithal was a good centre of trade and commerce but it lacked the facility of Higher Education. A large number of young boys and girls had to go to distant places for higher studies. In the year 1953, some eminent persons of Kaithal thought that a college should be set up in the city and they made a determined effort in this direction under the leadership of a well-known philanthropist, Seth Makhan Lal. In 1954, charitable educational society called Rastriya Vidya Samiti was registered and the first college of the city i.e. R.K.S.D. College was established by this society. In the beginning it was started as an Intermediate College in a rented building. Later on, it was shifted to the present building which is spread over 12 acres of land having a prime location on the Ambala-Hissar highway.

Gateway of Knowledge
Now it became a full-fledged degree college with Arts, Science & Commerce streams. With the help of the local politicians, public support and ceaseless efforts of different Governing Bodies as well as the Principals and the faculty of the college, it soon acquired the status of a PG College when the first PG Course i.e. M.A.(Hindi) was started in 1976. Thereafter, it covered many milestones over a period of 35 years and introduced many more PG & UG courses like M.A.(Pol.Sc.), M.A.(Eng.), M.A.(Economics) , M.Com., BCA and  BBA. 
            In the year 2003, another feather was added to its cap when Evening Session was started to enable those students to get admission in the College who could not be admitted in the morning session. Today, the college has a strength of 3600 students in the morning session and 800 students in the evening session. It is reckoned among the first 5 colleges of the Kurukshetra University and has earned enviable reputation in the field of academics, sports and cultural activities. It is not known only as one of the best colleges of Haryana but has also made its name nationally and internationally through its achievements in various fields year after year. 
            The parent body of the college i.e. Rastriya Vidya Samiti(Regd.) and the Management of the College gave a new direction to the institution by diversifying its educational programme as per the demand of the times. In the year 1994, the management started a Senior Secondary Public School in one portion of the building with a strength of just 110 students. The school progressed by leaps and bounds and today it is known as one of the best schools of the town with a strength of 2500 students. It is equipped with all kind of ultra-modern facilities like air conditioned class rooms, smart classes, swimming pool etc. and is the first choice of the parents of the area for their kids. In the year 2004 it took another stride when R.K.S.D. College of Pharmacy having Diploma as well as Graduate courses was set up. Yet again in the year 2006, keeping in view  the growing demand of the people, R.K.S.D. College of Education was started. As such today R.K.S.D. is not only a single degree college but a group of institutions. With the visionary and missionary approach of the management and dedicated effort of the Principals as well as the faculty of all the constituent institutions of the R.K.S.D. family, many more specialized courses are going to be introduced in the near future.
